            Energy Consumption Analysis and Optimization: DeepMind can analyze
            large amounts of data on the energy consumption of buildings,
            transportation systems, or other infrastructures, identifying
            consumption patterns and areas for improvement. Then, using advanced
            machine learning algorithms, it can recommend specific adjustments
            to optimize energy consumption and reduce operational costs.

            Demand Prediction and Management: DeepMind can predict future energy
            demand for different structures and systems, enabling proactive
            energy management. This involves anticipating demand peaks and
            dynamically adjusting energy production or supply to efficiently
            meet needs and avoid waste.

            Integration of Efficient Technologies: DeepMind can assist in
            integrating and optimizing more efficient energy technologies, such
            as renewable energy systems, energy storage systems, or intelligent
            load management devices. By optimizing the configuration and
            operation of these technologies, the overall energy efficiency of
            structures and systems can be significantly improved.
